Set-up Apache/HTTPD

1. dhclient to request ip address (may take a moment)

2. "ip addr" to see if you have an IP - write down IP for later. "ping -c1 google.com" for good measure.

3. yum install -y httpd   (may take a moment)

4. firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

5. firewall-cmd --reload

6. firewall-cmd --query-port=80/tcp (should report "yes")

7. systemctl start httpd

8. systemctl status httpd


Change HTTPD Port:
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Update Firewall


Create CA

- Use Bridged networking
- Make sure you have an IP Address
- Create a user account that you can use with SCP (Links to an external site.) to copy files to the server.
- useradd username
- passwd username password_for_account
- Make sure SSHD is running (we will need it to scp files)
- Update firewall to always allow port 22 (SSH/SCP)


I. Create the Certificate Authority

On CA:
cd /etc/pki/CA
touch index.txt   
echo 1000 > serial

openssl genrsa -des3 -out private/cakey.pem 2048
Describe this step and what the command arguments mean 

openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key private/cakey.pem -out cacert.pem
 

II. Create the certificate request on your web server
On Web Server:

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout websrv.key -out websrv.csr
scp websrv.csr USER@CA:/etc/pki/CA


 
III. Sign the certificate on the Certificate Authority

On the CA

openssl ca -out websrv.crt -infiles websrv.csr
scp websrv.crt USER@Webserver:/home/user



HTTPS SETUP

On your CentOS Web Server - make sure to copy the files into the following locations:
Web Server certificate: /etc/pki/tls/certs
Web server private key: /etc/pki/tls/private

yum -y install mod_ssl

3. Update /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
Find SSLCertificateFile and make sure the path and filename match your certificate file
Find SSLCertificateKeyFile and make sure the path and filename match your key file

4. Update firewall to allow port 443 - reload firewall

5. Restart httpd

6. Browse to your server using HTTPS=
